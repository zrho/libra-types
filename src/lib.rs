//! Libra is a library for building constraint based type inference engines.
//! For an overview of the type language, see [`Type`].
//!
//! # Constraint Based Type Inference
//!
//! The intended usage of Libra is to infer or check the types of a program
//! in three stages:
//!
//!  1. **Constraint Generation:** We traverse the input program and generate
//!     types and type constraints in a [`TypeSet`] that together describe the type inference
//!     problem associated to the program. During this process we keep track of
//!     the association between locations in the program and the [`TypeIndex`]s
//!     in the [`TypeSet`] that should correspond to the type of that program location.
//!  2. **Constraint Solving:** Once all types and constraints are collected in the
//!     [`TypeSet`], we solve the type constraints. The [`TypeSet`] keeps track of
//!     constraints that remain unsolved. For any such constraint, a user provided
//!     procedure uses unification to incorporate the knowledge encoded in the
//!     constraint into the [`TypeSet`]. The procedure can then decide whether to
//!     consider the constraint solved, to signal an error or to postpone solving
//!     the constraint to when more information becomes known.
//!     Postponed constraints are reawakened when one of their referenced types changes.
//!  3. **Elaboration:** After all constraints are solved, we extract the type information
//!     from the [`TypeSet`] to generate a program representation with type annotations.
//!     This step uses the association between [`TypeIndex`]s and program locations that
//!     has been recorded in the constraint generation step.
//!
//! The names of type constructors and of row labels are drawn from a
//! user-specified type `L` that must implement [`Copy`] and [`Eq`].
//! This is intended to be used together with
//! [string interning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning).
//!
//! # The Type System
//!
//! ## Polymorphism
//!
//! We believe that [let should not be generalised](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tldi10-vytiniotis.pdf).
//! Classical Hindley Milner type systems perform type generalisation at local
//! let bindings. Unfortunately this system is incompatible with a general
//! and extensible constraint system. We therefore do not implement support
//! for local implicit generalisation in libra. That design choice also paves
//! the way for potential future support of [local assumptions](https://simon.peytonjones.org/outsideinx/).
//!
//! ## Rows
//!
//! Libra supports a form of row types with
//! [scoped labels](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scopedlabels.pdf).
//! Rows can be used to model (extensible) record types and variant types.
//! A row is a sequence of row cons cells, specifying a label, a type and the
//! rest of the row.
//! Depending on the type that the row ends in, we classify rows as follows:
//!
//!  - **Closed Row:** The sequence ends in an empty row.
//!  - **Open Row:** The sequence ends in a row variable.
//!  - **Improper Row:** The sequence ends in a type that is not a row.
//!
//! Entries with different labels can be exchanged freely, while the order
//! of entries with the same label must be preserved.
//! This avoids label conflicts when using row polymorphism.
//! In cases where duplicate labels are not desired, this can be enforced
//! by using custom constraints.
//! We currently do not support rows with
//! [first class labels](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/fclabels.pdf)
//! directly, but this feature can be (partly) simulated using constraints as well.
//!
//! # Type Errors
//!
//! A type inference engine should not only work when the program is well-typed,
//! but also allow for diagnostics in case of a type error.
//! Producing helpful diagnostics is a difficult and underspecified problem.
//! Classical implementations of Hindley Milner type inference stop at the first
//! type error that is encountered, which due to the non-local nature of unification
//! may also be far from the location of the actual mistake in the code.
//!
//! Libra is designed to be used with the
//! [Mycroft](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3022671.2983994)
//! approach to error reporting.
//! When Libra encounters an error, it can produce an *unsatisfiable core*, i.e.
//! a subset of the type constraints which can not be simultaneously satisfied.
//! The unsatisfiable core can then be used to selectively disable individual
//! constraints until a (close to) minimal set of constraints is found without
//! which the type inference problem is satisfiable.
//! These error constraints can then be used to produce the appropriate error messages.
//! This approach for error reporting was chosen since it can produce decent
//! quality type errors, does not stop at the first error but reports multiple
//! errors, and allows for extensibility in the constraint language.
//!
//! In the case of an error, Mycroft runs the type inference engine many times.
//! Depending on the size of the program and the complexity of the custom
//! constraint language, this process may be slow.
//! For situations where high quality error messages are not necessary,
//! the repeated resolving may be skipped and the ill-typed program rejected
//! immediately.
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! This library is deliberately kept small, favouring composable abstractions
//! that can be used as the foundation for a variety of type system features.
//! As a consequence, it might not be immediately obvious how some common high
//! level features map into libra types. Below we list some examples.
//!
//! ## Kinds
//! ## Algebraic Data Types
//! ## Type Classes
//! ## Type Families as Constraints
//! ## Data Kinds and Primitives
//! ## Type Level Lists
//! ## Skolem Variables
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! Type inference should be fast. It can appear as part of a language server
//! and therefore impact the editing experience of a programmer. It is part of
//! a build process and should not dramatically slow down the compilation of
//! large programs. Ideally type inference and ideally type checking should
//! be fast enough that there is no temptation to omit it.
//!
//! Cloning a TypeSet is O(n). This is not entirely ideal since the Mycroft
//! error reporting scheme needs a clone for every iteration, including the
//! first one for the happy case in which no type errors occur. So far we
//! havenâ€™t found a way to avoid this without a performance penalty in practice.
//! Instead we ensure that cloning a TypeSet amounts to a small and constant
//! number of heap allocations and calls to memcpy.
