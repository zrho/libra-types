# Introduction

Libra implements a small core of composable and powerful abstractions that can be
used to build a variety of type systems for a variety of languages.
Here we give an overview over the design of Libra,
and illustrate several recipes of how to implement common type system features
on top of the basic building blocks provided by the library.
